GYM Open Air
==========

Application submitted at Hackathon Americas Datafest

Objetives: We have some open air gyms with free fitness class. This app aim help people find the nearest gym, attend workout sessions, and have a healthier life. 

Restrictions: For now the app only works in Recife since we used its open data.

Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API do Google Maps.

It is very important to mention that this project reuses code from the app developed by Rodrigo Portillo and Yelken Gonzales, "Busca Saúde", which uses open data and provides updated information about clinics and hospitals nearby [See more here] (http://blogs.ne10.uol.com.br/mundobit/2013/07/20/hackaton-cidadao-premia-aplicativos-sobre-saude-e-educacao-na-campus-party-recife/?doing_wp_cron=1391237944.7107429504394531250000#sthash.EcrvAExW.dpuf).
